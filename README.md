# 3-themed-calculator

My first major JS project. Instead of just making a basic calculator I decided to practice my grid & mobile first skills and throw in some tailwind into the mix.

I had to learn a lot to overcome this project but i'm proud that it works as inteded. I created 3 color themes to practice dom manipulation utilizing tailwind classes.
